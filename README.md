# My Sway configuration

Currently I use [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway), [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) and swaylock.

I manage my configuration with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/):
- Clone this repo in your Stow directory, i.e. `~/dotfiles`
- `git clone https://github.com/Depau/sway-configs.git ~/dotfiles/sway && cd ~/dotfiles`
- `stow sway` to apply

## Stuff found in `exec` commands not in this repo
